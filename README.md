The [Angular Tree Grid](https://www.syncfusion.com/angular-components/angular-tree-grid?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=angular-tree-grid-github-samples) is a feature-rich component used to visualize self-referential hierarchical (tree-like structure) data effectively in a tabular format. Its rich feature set includes many functionalities like data binding, editing, sorting, filtering, paging, aggregating rows, and exporting to Excel, CSV, and PDF formats.

## Features and Benefits of Angular Tree Grid Component

### Data binding
Bind data seamlessly with various local and remote data sources such as JSON, RESTful services, OData services, and WCF services. It uses the data manager to handle data and supports customizing data requests and processing.

### Editing
The Angular Tree Grid provides full support to create, read, update, and delete operations (CRUD). It performs editing operations with JSON collection or remote data service with the help of data manager.

### Aggregation
Easily visualize the aggregates of the TreeGrid column values using the summary option. Aggregates can be customized to show their value in every hierarchy with a set of predefined summary types.

### Paging
Through paging, a segment of data can be viewed from the assigned data source. The Angular Tree Grid offers built-in pager UI with options to customize its entire UI. It also has an on-demand paging mode for effective data retrieval from remote web services.

### Filtering
Angular Tree Grid filtering allows users to view the required data in the Angular Tree Grid. The Angular Tree Grid supports various filter types such as filter bar and menu. The appropriate filter type can be chosen based on the application. These filter types support number, string, date, and Boolean. Options to customize filter operators, case sensitivity, and diacritics are also available.

### Sorting
The Ang Tree Grid allows users to sort a column by simply clicking on the header. A Ctrl + header click performs multi-sorting. Allows sorting data either in the ascending or descending order.

### Selection
The Angular Tree Grid allows selecting rows or cells. One or more rows or cells can also be selected by holding Ctrl or Command, or programmatically.

### Width and Height
Allows changing the Angular Tree Grid size by setting the width and height properties. Horizontal and vertical scrollbars will appear when the content overflows the Tree Grid element. For the Angular Tree Grid to fill its parent container, the user has to simply set the height and width to 100%.

### Column
Columns define the schema of a data source in Angular Tree Grid. It supports formatting, column definitions, text wrapping, column chooser, column menu, column reorder, and other important features.

### Context menu
The Angular Tree Grid Context Menu provides a list of actions to be performed. It appears when a cell, header, or pager is right-clicked. The context menu items can be customized according to user preference.

### Stacked headers
Stacked headers allow grouping and visualizing column headers in a stacked manner. There is no limit to the number of columns that can be stacked. The data columns can still be sorted and filtered.

### Themes
Four built-in SASS-based themes are available such as: Material, Bootstrap, Fabric, and High Contrast. Simplify theme customization either by overriding the existing SASS styling or creating custom themes by using the Theme Studio application.

### Globalization
Angular Tree Grid enables users from different locales to use it by formatting the date, currency, and numbering to suit locale preferences. It uses the internalization (i18n) library to handle value formatting.
